# Gyro Crawler

This is a game under development. This document may be inaccurate and out of date.
At the time of writing, the application is a demo of "stars" moving around the screen due to "WASD" input. The current main development is on the interface-library, which wraps OpenGL. Note that the "embed-all.sh" script expects the user to have installed [this utility](https://github.com/euleristic/File-as-Macro) under the name Embedder. Feel free to do this step manually, for now.
